Welcome to the Virtual Artist 112 App!

In this app, we'll use colors to give the user a full makeover. They can try different colors, 
shades, and sharpness for different parts of their face, giving them the opportunity to try on makeup 
in a sanitary and efficient way. 

The features included in this project are made for as seamless a user experience as possible. These include:
- Different shades of makeup for different parts of the face- all based on real products on sephora.com
- The ability to view bestsellers on sephora.com - and open them from the app if interested
- Incorporation of a Machine Learning dataset of facial landmarks for accurate facial feature detection
- The ability to send a text message of the final look to a user

To run this application, the following libraries must be downloaded: 
- imutils
- tkinter
- openCV
- numpy
- pillow
- beautiful soup
- os
- webbrowser
- flickrapi
- requests
- dlib
- math
- json
- requests
- urllib

All of these are included in the setup.bat script included with this download. Please run setup.bat before using the app. The main file, GUI.py, also contains other files that were used for this project and were written by the author. Contact me directly for those files. 

Photos sent via text message are first uploaded to flickr and sent as a url to the user. For the purposes of this Term Project,
I will be clearing my flickr profile every 24 hours to make sure photos uploaded are not public. However, be warned that this 
does occur before you send yourself a text message of your picture. If you want your photo cleared immediately, contact 
slakdawa@andrew.cmu.edu

To use the app, open the file titled 'GUI.' Simply click on the facial feature you want to modify, click on a color from the swatches below the image,
click on blend and sharpen to change the opacity, and text yourself when ready! If you want to see bestsellers on sephora 
(this updates live), simply scroll on the right-hand menu and click on the products that you think are most interesting. 
A warning about this, however: some links on sephora.com may be broken or have the wrong reference- this was an issue 
further explored that did not seem to have a solution. 

Enjoy the app, and remember: your smile is the most beautiful makeover you could ever give yourself!
